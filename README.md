# Lab Manual: Assembly Language 

## About  
This repository contains my solutions to assembly language lab exercises. Each solution is carefully documented, reflecting my progress and understanding of low-level programming concepts.  

## Structure  
The repository is organized by lab sessions, with each directory containing:  
- **Code**: The `.asm` files for each lab problem.  
- **Explanation**: A markdown file explaining the logic and approach used.  
- **Screenshots**: Output screenshots (where applicable).  

## Goals  
- Strengthen my understanding of assembly language programming.  
- Maintain a well-documented archive of lab solutions for future reference.  

## Usage  
Feel free to explore the repository, learn from the examples, or fork it for your own practice. If you have questions, suggestions, or feedback, donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue!
